1) Airline's Maintenance System

After every flight, seats with even-numbered seat IDs need to be flagged for special
cleaning due to proximity to air vents. The system receives a list of seat numbers that
were occupied during the flight.

To help the cleaning crew, you must replace every even seat number in the list with 0
to indicate that those seats need to be cleaned.

ðŸ”¹ Test case 01 :
Input: [2, 4, 6, 8]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0]

ðŸ”¹ Test case 02 :
Input: [12, 13, 14]
Output: [0, 13, 0]

2)Top Two Unique Scores

A teacher wants to reward the top two scoring students in a test. Given the list of
scores, find the two highest unique scores.

Write a function top_two_scores(scores) that returns the two highest unique scores.

3)Room Rating Tracker

The system tracks the ratings given by students for the condition of their rooms after staying there for a semester. These ratings can be positive (indicating good condition) or negative (indicating poor condition).

The maintenance team needs to focus on rooms with negative ratings. However, the system should not store negative ratings in the database but should instead convert those negative ratings into a positive score to indicate the magnitude of the problem for each room.

ðŸ”§ Task:
Write a function `update_room_ratings(ratings)` that takes a list of room ratings and returns a list where all negative ratings are replaced by their squares, while keeping the positive ratings unchanged.

Input:  [1, -4, 2, -8, 5]
Output: [1, 16, 2, 64, 5]

ðŸ”¹ Test Case 02:
Input:  [0, 5, 10]
Output: [0, 5, 10]
