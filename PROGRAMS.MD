✈️ Airline's Maintenance System

After every flight, seats with even-numbered seat IDs need to be flagged for special
cleaning due to proximity to air vents. The system receives a list of seat numbers that
were occupied during the flight.

To help the cleaning crew, you must replace every even seat number in the list with 0
to indicate that those seats need to be cleaned.

🔹 Test case 01 :
Input: [2, 4, 6, 8]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 0]

🔹 Test case 02 :
Input: [12, 13, 14]
Output: [0, 13, 0]
